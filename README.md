# Guest Role

This Omeka S module adds a user role with no admin permissions. It is a
lightweight alternative to
[Guest](https://github.com/Daniel-KM/Omeka-S-module-Guest) for those who only
need the user role and not all features provided by the Guest module.

## Switch to Guest

If you started using Guest Role and you want more features, you can easily switch
to Guest by following these steps:

1. Install and activate Guest
2. Uninstall Guest Role
3. Remove GuestRole module directory
